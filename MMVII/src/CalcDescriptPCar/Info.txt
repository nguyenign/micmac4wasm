This folder will contains the soft for computation of objects to match for TieP :

    * extraction of "salient" point
    * computation of descriptors


Also this may be conceptually two different concept, the computation is done
in the same  movement are they both use gaussian pyramids that are time consuming
to compute and would require many hard disk space to save.
